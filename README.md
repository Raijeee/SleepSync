# Unit 3: Client project (Ryu Koshiba's sleeping app)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
My Roommate, Ryu Koshiba has recently been sleep deprived and wants to understand his sleep pattern throughout the month. To do this, Ryu wants an app developer to create an app that tracks his duration of sleep, quality of sleep, frequency of sleep, and time going to bed to best understand his sleep pattern. 

## Proposed Solution:

### Design Statement
I will design and make an app that tracks the start/end time, duration, quality, and frequency of sleep for my client who is my roommate, Ryu Koshiba. The application will be able to keep track of unique individual users' sleep stats (start/end time, duration, quality and frequency) via the use of a login system. To ensure security and privacy, the login system will have a secure username and password all saved in a local database. The application will have a clear and simple GUI so that users can easily guide themselves throughout the app. This all will be created using the Python programming language with the help of KivyMD for GUI construction. All code will be created and developed on the app, Pycharm. This app will take 4 weeks to complete and will be evaluated according to the criteria.
