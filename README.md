# Unit 3: Project Client

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
My Roommate, Ryu Koshiba has recently been sleep deprived and wants to understand his sleep pattern throughout the month. To do this, Ryu wants an app developer to create an app that tracks his duration of sleep, quality of sleep, frequency of sleep, and time going to bed to best understand his sleep pattern. 

## Proposed Solution:

### Design Statement
I will design and make an app that tracks the start/end time, duration, quality, and frequency of sleep for my client who is my roommate, Ryu Koshiba. The application will be able to keep track of unique individual users' sleep stats (start/end time, duration, quality and frequency) via the use of a login system. To ensure security and privacy, the login system will have a secure username and password all saved in a local database using SQLite through console. The application will have a clear and simple GUI so that users can easily guide themselves throughout the app. This all will be created using the Python programming language with the help of KivyMD for GUI construction. All code will be created and developed on the app, Pycharm. This app will take 4 weeks to complete and will be evaluated according to the criteria. 

## Justification

### Why Python?
Out of every programming language, I have chosen to use Python 3.x for numerous reasons. For starters, Python is the most well known and used programming language throughout the world (1). This will not only allow me to have greater access to resources and references but also the app will also be compatible with a greater number of systems, improving the overall experience of the client. Personally I am the most comfortable with programming Python and so not only will everything be streamlined but also the client will receive the app in a timely manner, without any extensions of the due date. Judging by the benefits of both the programmer and client, its safe to say that Python is the right programming language to use for this project. 

### Why KivyMD?
KivyMD will be used to construct the graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to navigate throughout the app. I have chosen KivyMD because not only is KivyMD compatible throughout all 3 main operating systems, but also is one of the more simpler GUI language to learn (2). KivyMD’s goal, “to approximate Google's Material Design spec as close as possible without sacrificing ease of use or application performance.” (3) also greatly relates to the clients experience as the GUI is what the client actually sees and a good GUI is always appreciated in every application. Through these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that KivyMD is the most appropriate GUI node for my project. 

### Why SQLite?
SQLite is a database engine written in the C language(4) but also comes bundled with Python and can be used in any Python applications without having to install any additional software (5). I am also most familiar with this database structure and console. This will allow me to create the database quickly and will match the client's deadline more effectively. With this flexibility and ease of use, I have decided to use SQLite for this project's database. 

## Success Criteria
1. The application must contain a GUI log in screen, registration screen, and a screen to enter sleep data.
2. The application will record duration, quality, start, and end time of sleep. 
3. The application must contain all the data in a database.
4. The user will be able to input all data through the GUI.
5. The log in system must include a username, password and Email.
6. The user will be able to access past inputed data.
